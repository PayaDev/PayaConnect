### Product Transaction Setting Overrides
The following fields can be used on a per transaction basis.  If a field is provided, **the corresponding field from the Product Transaction being used will be ignored** and the override field value is then used instead.

For example, if `auto_decline_zip` is set to true on the Product Transaction, but `auto_decline_zip_override` is provided in transaction request with a value of `false`, then the transaction will NOT automatically decline due to a bad zip.

### Perform an AVS Only Transaction
For information about AVS response codes and what they indicate, please take a look at [AVS Response Codes]().  While this action does not require billing address information, that data is necessary to return a valid AVS response from the processor. 

Please note that the Paya Connect sandbox will return CVV responses here, but some of our processors do not support CVV responses for this transaction type.

See our [Test Data](https://github.com/PayaDev/PayaConnect/blob/master/TestData.md) for additional test scenarios.  Any other AVS will decline the AVS but not decline the transaction. Not sending AVS will decline the AVS but not decline the transaction.

**Searching for Records**

There are a number of filters that can be used to search for transactions by including them as querystring parameters in your Request URL.  Below you will find examples for a few use cases although we encourage you to take a look at the full Filters list to consider additional strategies that can be used for finding transactions.

### Quick Invoice Payments
By using the trx_source_id field as a querystring parameter we can search for transactions tied to Quick Invoices like so:

`GET /v2/transactions?trx_source_id=8`

You can add additional parameters to narrow your results even further like so:

`GET /v2/transactions?trx_source_id=8&created_ts=custom&created_ts_from=1556424000&created_ts_to=1556683199`

 
**Editing a Transaction**

- If contact_id is provided, ensure it belongs to the same location as the transaction.  You cannot move a transaction across locations.
- Only the fields depicted below are allowed for action of "edit" although which fields are necessary depend on the desired result.

`PUT /v2/transactions/{id}`

### Paya ACH Authorization Requirements
#### Authorization Page - PPD

PPD is for prearranged payment and deposit entries on personal bank account in which the Receiver is required to complete a written authorization form and must provide physical or digital signature. Digital signatures must be compliant with the ESign Act.

Additionally, the authorization must provide the Receiver with the method to revoke his authorization by notifying the Originator in the manner prescribed, and the time frame in which the revocation of the authorization must be provided.

The Originator (Merchant) must have the following verbiage (or substantially similar) on the written authorization form:

> By signing below, I authorize the Merchant to convert this transaction into an Electronic Funds Transfer transaction or paper draft, and to debit this account for the amount as identified above and to the terms stated here. This authorization shall remain in effect until the Merchant receives written notification from me of intent to terminate at such time and in such manner as to afford the Merchant a reasonable opportunity to act. I authorize this plan to continue as long as the payment amount remains unchanged until the amount owed the Merchant is paid off, or unless the plan is terminated earlier by me as stated above. I understand that all changes such as payment amount, frequency, bank account number change, will require a new ACH Debit Payment Authorization Form to be filled out and submitted to Merchant 15 days prior to any change being implemented.
>
> In the event that I choose to revoke this authorization, I will do so by contacting the merchant directly. Processing times may not allow for revocation of this authorization.
>
>I understand that this payment plan may be cancelled by the Merchant due to NSF (Non-sufficient Funds). In the event this draft or EFT is returned unpaid, I will be liable to pay an NSF fee of $25.00 (or the amount allowable by law), that may be automatically debited to this bank account via draft or EFT for each NSF.

#### Authorization Page - CCD
CCD is for Corporate Credit or Debit entries on business bank accounts in which the Receiver is required to complete a written authorization form, contract, or agreement that with the Originator and Receiver have both agreed to be bound by the ACH Rules and the Receiver must provide physical or digital signature. Digital signatures must be compliant with the ESign Act.

Additionally, the authorization must provide the Receiver with the method to revoke his authorization by notifying the Originator in the manner prescribed, and the time frame in which the revocation of the authorization must be provided.

The Originator (Merchant) must have the following verbiage (or substantially similar) listed on the written authorization form, contract, or agreement:

> Submission of this transaction assumes an agreement is in place between both parties to allow converting this transaction into an Electronic Funds Transfer transaction or paper draft, and to debit this account for the amount of the transaction. Additionally, the agreement further states that in the event this draft or EFT is returned unpaid, a service fee, as allowable by law, will be charged to this account via draft or EFT. In the event you choose to revoke this authorization, please do so by contacting the merchant directly. Please note that processing times may not allow for revocation of this authorization.

#### Authorization Page - WEB

#### Additional Endpoint Actions
Depending on your ACH processor, there are additional actions that can be performed.  The table below describes these additional actions as well as the corresponding SEC codes they can be used with.

**Note**: *It is important to note that for the "Payroll" action, an additional field "ach_identifier" must be provided in the POST with value of "P".*

| Action   | Identifier | PPD | CCD | WEB | TEL | POP | C21 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Payroll  | P          |     |     |     |     | ✔   | ✔   | This is used in schemas for POP and Check 21 for business and payroll checks. What this does is NOT link the driver’s license to the routing/account numbers since the person writing/cashing the check is usually not the business.                                                                                                 |
| Override |            |     |     |     | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   | This is used in schemas for POP, TEL, and Check 21 when the host system receives a manager needed message to void the previous transaction and input a new transaction in its place.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Update   |            |     |     |     |     | ✔   | ✔   | This is used in schemas for POP and Check 21 for OCR transactions that already have complete data in the data packet. It forces the transaction to run as a normal POP or Check 21 transaction on an OCR terminal. This is normally done when a change is needed to a transaction that was submitted under a normal OCR transaction. |
 

### Performing a Payroll Transaction
In the example below we will demonstrate how the Payroll (P) ACH identifier can be used.

`POST /v2/transactions`

Request
```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "action": "debit",
    "payment_method": "ach",
    "ach_identifier": "P", // Notice the "P" identifier being used here
    "transaction_amount": "777777.07",
    "location_api_id": "location_api_id_zach_@#$%",
    "product_transaction_id": "11e8c590bb25026ea3f31cf6",
    "ach_sec_code": "C21",
    "account_holder_name": "trx+C21@1612 (1616/)-trx",
    "check_number": "8520748520963",
    "account_type": "checking",
    "account_number": "24345",
    "routing": "051904524",
    "image_front": "U29tZVN0cmluZ09idmlvdXNseU5vdEJhc2U2NEVuY29kZWQ=",
    "image_back": "U29tZVN0cmluZ09idmlvdXNseU5vdEJhc2U2NEVuY29kZWQ=",
    "billing_zip": "58469",
    "billing_street": "1612-1616*street",
    "billing_city": "1612-34645656city",
    "billing_state": "VI",
    "billing_phone": "7894561230",
    "track_data": "T051904524T 741025349520O 8520748520963",
    "dob_year": "2000",
    "ssn4": "8527"
  }
}
```
 

### Performing an Override
If the API responds with "Manager Approval Needed" message, an override transaction will also need to be created.

`POST /v2/transactions/{id}/override`

Request
```json
{
    // Nothing Needed Here - Empty Payload
}
```
 

### Performing an Update
If for whatever reason the track data or transaction amount need to be changed for a transaction, this can be acheived by performaning an Update.

- Updates can only be made in the same calendar day.
- You will need to [Void]() the original transaction (manually) and then POST the update.  
- If the original transaction cannot be Voided, you must perform a [Refund]() on the original transaction and then perform a new POST (not an update) to /v2/transactions.

`POST /v2/transactions/{id}/achupdate`

Request
```json
{
    "transaction": {
        "track_data": "T211287447T 234565432678O 4567890234567",
        "trnsaction_amount": "34.09"
    }
}
```
 

## Filters

While Expands will provide extra data, you can use filters to limit record results. Most fields listed in the fields section can be used to filter results.

Say, for example, that you only wanted to find transactions where the last four digits of the card were 1234. You could include that filter in the URL of the GET request like so:

`/v2/transactions?last_four=1234`

Most of the filters use a “like” or “similar to” filter. so filtering on account_holder_name of “smith” would return records containing “john smith” and “jane smith”. Here is another example that filter records that are approved (auth and sale) and are also card type visa:

`/v2/transactions?account_type=visa&status_id=101,102`

One additional type of filter can be applied to the dollar amount fields. This filter allows for a range of values to be searched. If you would like to search for a dollar amount within a range, a pipe symbol is used. Here is an example of this type of filter:

`/v2/transactions?transaction_amount=10.00|10.99`

The above filter will limit results to transaction_amount between $10.00 and $10.99 inclusive.

There is additional functionality that allows searching and filtering on timestamp fields. If you are looking for transaction from today, you can simply search on the created_ts field as follows:

`/v2/transactions?created_ts=today`

And for yesterday you could do the following:

`/v2/transactions?created_ts=yesterday`

If you need more flexibility on dates, you can set the timestamp filter to custom and supply a custom from and to date like so:

`/v2/transactions?created_ts=custom&created_ts_from=1511382234&created_ts_to=1511385997`

When searching on timestamp fields, the list below contains all the predefined values that can be used:

- today
- yesterday
- this week
- last week
- last 30 days
- this month
- last month
- custom

An example of “expanding” this endpoint to one of the above related records would look like this:

`/v2/transactions/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?expand=location`

To use multiple expands on this endpoint, simply include them both separated by a comma like so:

`/v2/transactions/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?expand=location,created_user`

EXAMPLE: CONTACT EXPAND
`GET /v2/transactions?expand=contact`
